# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BD & IPO Scoring Module is a proprietary analytical system designed to evaluate biotech companies as potential partnering targets and predict the timing and valuation of business development (BD) deals and initial public offerings (IPOs). The system cross-references pipeline quality, funding runway, and comparable market exits to generate comprehensive scoring reports that inform strategic investment and partnership decisions.

3. WHEN generating scores THEN the system SHALL use a 1-5 scale for each evaluation pillar
4. IF required data is missing THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide the missing information
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show both raw scores and weighted values for transparency

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing financial data THEN the system SHALL evaluate current cash position and burn rate
2. WHEN assessing funding runway THEN the system SHALL calculate estimated time to next financing need
3. WHEN evaluating financial readiness THEN the system SHALL score capital intensity requirements
4. WHEN financial analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL predict optimal BD/IPO timing windows
5. IF financial data is outdated THEN the system SHALL warn users about data freshness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a market researcher, I want the system to incorporate comparable market exits data, so that I can benchmark valuations against similar transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing valuation analysis THEN the system SHALL reference comparable BD deals and IPO transactions
2. WHEN identifying comparables THEN the system SHALL match by therapeutic area, development stage, and market size
3. WHEN calculating valuations THEN the system SHALL provide multiple valuation scenarios based on different exit strategies
4. WHEN market analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL highlight key valuation drivers and risks
5. IF comparable data is limited THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels in valuation estimates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a strategic planning manager, I want to customize scoring weights and criteria, so that I can align the evaluation with our specific investment thesis and priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to adjust weighting for each evaluation pillar
2. WHEN weights are modified THEN the system SHALL recalculate scores in real-time
3. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL store custom weighting profiles for reuse
4. WHEN using custom weights THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which profile is active
5. IF weight adjustments create invalid configurations THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and provide guidance

### Requirement 6
