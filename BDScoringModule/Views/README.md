- `EvaluationStep`: Navigation state enum

### UI Components Utilized
- `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`
- `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`
- `StatusBadge` with different styles
- `ProgressBar` for score visualization
- `MetricCard` for key metrics display

### Requirements Compliance

#### Requirement 1.1 (Company Data Input and Scoring)
✅ Implemented comprehensive data input forms
✅ Multi-step workflow for data collection
✅ Scoring calculation and display

#### Requirement 1.4 (Missing Data Prompts)
✅ Form validation with required fields

- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Export functionality for evaluations
- Historical evaluation tracking
- Batch evaluation capabilities

### Files Modified/Created
1. `CompanyEvaluationView.swift` - Main implementation
2. `CompanyEvaluationViewTests.swift` - Comprehensive test suite
3. Supporting types and enums for workflow management
4. Integration with existing data models and UI components

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements for task 9.3, providing a complete multi-step evaluation workflow with comprehensive UI testing coverage.
